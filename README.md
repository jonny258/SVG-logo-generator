# Logo Maker

## Description
This is a command-line application that allows users to create an SVG logo based on their input.

## Usage
Run node index.js in your terminal to start the program. You will be prompted to enter the text, text color, shape, and shape color for your logo.

## Text Input
You can enter up to three characters for your text input.

## Color Input
For both text and shape color, you can enter either a color keyword (e.g. "red", "blue") or a hexadecimal color code (e.g. "#FF0000", "#0000FF").

## Shape Input
You will be presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square.

Once you have entered input for all the prompts, an SVG file named logo.svg will be created in the project folder, and the output message "Generated logo.svg" will be displayed in the terminal.

## Viewing Your Logo
To view your logo, open the logo.svg file in a browser. You should see a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria you entered.
